    Steps to take:
   </h2>
   <ol> 
      <li>Toast the oats:<br>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the oats and toast, stirring occasionally, until they begin to smell fragrant and nutty, 5 to 7 minutes.</li><br>
      <li>Cook the oats:<br>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, bring the water, milk, and salt to a low simmer. Add the toasted oats and gently stir a few times.<br>
          In a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, bring the water, milk, and salt to a low simmer. Add the toasted oats and gently stir a few times.<br>
          Bring the oats to a slow boil, then decrease the heat to low and partially cover. Cook, stirring occasionally to avoid sticking or clumping, until the oatmeal is thick and the oats are softened, 25 to 30 minutes.<br>
          The porridge may still be a little loose at this point, but will continue to soak up liquid as it sits.</li><br>
      <li>Let the oatmeal sit:<br>
          Place the lid slightly ajar and adjust the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook, without stirring, until the outlines of the grains of rice are no longer visible, about 1 1/2 hours.</li><br>
      <li>Serve the oatmeal:<br>
        Divide the oatmeal between bowls, top with brown sugar and cream, and serve.</li><br>
