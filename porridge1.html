    Steps to take:
   </h2>
   <ol> 
      <li>Season the chicken:<br>Add the sliced chicken breast, minced ginger, chopped whites from the green onions, chicken bouillon, and white pepper in a medium bowl and stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate until the congee is ready.</li><br>
      <li>Prepare the rice:<br>Wash and rinse the rice with cold water until the water is clear. Strain the rice.</li><br>
      <li>Cook the congee:<br>
          Add the chicken stock to a large pot over high heat and bring to a rippling boil. Lower the heat to medium and add the rice. Give the rice a gentle swirl to distribute it in an even layer.<br>
          Place the lid slightly ajar and adjust the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook, without stirring, until the outlines of the grains of rice are no longer visible, about 1 1/2 hours.</li><br>
      <li>Add the chicken and cook:<br>
        Remove the lid and give the congee a gentle mix. You can add additional stock or water for a looser consistency, to your liking.<br>
        Add the seasoned chicken and submerged it into the congee. Stir and break up the chicken slices. Cook over medium heat or until the chicken is no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent the chicken from sticking to the pot.</li><br>
      <li>Garnish:<br>
        Add salt to taste. Add the chicken congee to a bowl or individual bowls and garnish with thinly sliced ginger and scallion greens. Serve.<br>
        Store leftover congee in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. The porridge will thicken over time; when reheating, add more stock or water to thin it out to your liking, if needed.</li><br>
